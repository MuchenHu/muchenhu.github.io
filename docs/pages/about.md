Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** 胡沐辰 :wave:,<br>

As a skilled programmer with a passion for machine learning, I am an aspiring Quant researcher/trader with substantial academic and practical experience in finance. I am interested in developing trading strategies and ensuring efficient trading activities to enhance market liquidity. 

I grew up in Jiangsu, China, and am fluent in both English and Mandarin.
