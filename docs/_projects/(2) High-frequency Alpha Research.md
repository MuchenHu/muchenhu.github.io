description: This project focuses on developing and testing high-frequency trading strategies on the Russell 3000 index. The project involved building a minute-level trade and quote dataset sourced from Wharton Research Data Services. A key component of the work was the development of an event-driven backtesting platform to evaluate the performance of minute-level trading strategies. The project also included designing predictive models, such as Elastic Net and XGBoost, to forecast one-minute future returns.

# High-Frequency Trading Strategy Development on Russell 3000

This course project, hosted by [SAIF Live Learning Center](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/mba/live-learning), ran from April to June 2023. It was advised by Professor [Qiushi Huang](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/huang-qiushi) from SAIF, SJTU, and Kevin Li from Tower Research Capital.

This project was built from scratch:
- Collected Russell 3000 index components in 2021.
- Collected and cleaned Trade and Quote(TAQ) dataset from Wharton Research Data Services(WRDS).
- Calculated minute bar statistics, including using the Lee-and-Ready algorithm.
- Developed of an event-driven backtesting platform.
- Designed predictive models, such as Elastic Net and XGBoost, to forecast one-minute future returns.
